# How to Embed SmartLead Magnet into Your Webflow Website

**Note:** To follow this guide, you should have administrative access to your Webflow site.

## 1. Log in to Your Webflow Dashboard

Go to your Webflow login page. Usually, it looks like this: `https://webflow.com/dashboard`.  
Enter your email and password.

## 2. Create or Edit a Page

Navigate to **Pages** in the left-hand side menu.  
Click **+ Create New Page** to create a new page. Alternatively, click on an existing page where you want to embed the iFrame and then click **Edit**.

## 3. Access the Embed Element

In the page editor, click on the **+ Add Elements** button on the left side of the screen.  
Scroll down to the **Components** section and drag the **Embed** element into the desired location on your page.

## 4. Paste the iFrame Code

Copy the iFrame code from the SmartLead Magnet platform.  
Paste the iFrame code in the Embed Code dialog box that appears after you drop the Embed element into your page.  
Your iFrame code should look something like this:

```html
<iframe src="https://smartleadmagnet.com/share/magentid" width="100%" 
    height="600" 
    style="border-radius:0.5rem; border:none; 
    max-width: 100%; 
    height: 70vh; /* Responsive height based on viewport height */
    min-height: 500px;" 
    loading="lazy"
    referrerpolicy="unsafe-url" 
    allow="clipboard-read;clipboard-write"
></iframe>
